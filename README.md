Got a new PC but no time to copy files from the old one.  
Just place to store links, copied files and revised source codes.

## Files
- Almost copied from others.  
- `breakingpoint.py` I copied the file from [here](https://www.leavesongs.com/PYTHON/resume-download-from-break-point-tool-by-python.html). A simple program which is useful while downloading large datasets.
